NonMetricSpaceLib
======================================================

This is a modified version of NonMetricSpaceLib, which contains the implementation of NAPP, SW and VP-Tree. The original version can be found form  [here](https://github.com/searchivarius/nmslib).

Main differences:

We disabled SIMD and multi-threading techniques.

##Prerequisites:

A modern compiler that supports C++11: G++ 4.7, Intel compiler 14, Clang 3.4.
- Boost (dev version).
- CMake (version 2.8 or over is needed)
- [Sample data](https://github.com/DBWangGroupUNSW/nns_benchmark/tree/master/data) (e.g., audio) is downloaded, including data points, query point. Note that the input format is .txt and the ground truth results can be generated before evaluating.

##Compile

To compile, go to the directory code and type:

cmake .
make  

##Build and Search

run_NAPP.sh, run_SW.sh, run_vptree.sh 

type run_NAPP.sh, run_SW.sh and run_vptree.sh to get the index and search results of NAAPP, Small World and VP-Tree.  

The search performance (time and recall) results are kept in the Flann/results directory.
