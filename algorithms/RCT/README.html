<h1 id="rct---rank-cover-tree">RCT - Rank Cover Tree</h1>
<p>The originial source code is obtained from the authors by email, who kindly allow us to release them through this benchmark.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
<li>A modern compiler that supports <code>C++11</code> (e.g., <code>gcc 4.7</code> and above)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/DBWangGroupUNSW/nns_benchmark/tree/master/data">A sample data</a> (e.g., audio) is downloaded, including data points, query points and ground truth results. Note that all data files downloaded should be put to the <code>./knn_benchmark/data</code> directory.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="compile-rctsrc">Compile (RCT/src)</h2>
<p>To compile the RCT program, go to <code>src</code> and type</p>
<pre><code>make</code></pre>
<h2 id="construct-rctscript">Construct (RCT/script)</h2>
<pre><code>build.sh</code></pre>
<p>Build index based on the data points, which is put to its index directory (i.e., <code>RCT/index</code>).</p>
<h2 id="search-rctscript">Search (RCT/script)</h2>
<pre><code>search.sh</code></pre>
<p>Note that, in our experiment paper, we tuen the <code>c</code> value of RCT search (i.e., restricting the number of neighboring nodes to be visited at each level of the structure) to achieve the trade-off between search speed and search quality (recall). The search performance (time and recall) results are kept in the <code>RCT/results</code> directory.</p>
